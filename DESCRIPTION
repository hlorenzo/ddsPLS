Title: Data-Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares for Mono and Multi-Block Data Sets
Description: Allows to build Data-Driven Sparse Partial Least Squares models. Multi-blocks with 
    high-dimensional settings are particularly sensible to this. 
    Number of components and regularization coefficients are automatically set. It comes with visualization
    functions and uses 'Rcpp' functions for fast computations and 'doParallel' to parallelize cross-validation. 
    An applet has been developed to apply this procedure.
    This is based on H Lorenzo, O Cloarec, R Thiebaut, J Saracco (2021), doi=10.1002/sam.11558.
